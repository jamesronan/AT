@ - apt wrapper

Usage: @ -[QRSU][cdfipqsuy] [<package name>|<search term>]

@ (at) is a wrapper around apt-*|dpkg programs in the style of Arch Linux's 
pacman. I got sick of remembering to type "cache" instead of "get" etc. and 
all the commands are sooo long.  Enter @. @ does all the thinking for you, tap
the right switch and @ applies the query to the correct application and even
requests sudo for the ones that require it.

This script should be softlinked to /usr/bin/@ on your system by doing this:

    sudo ln -sf /path/to/at.pl /usr/bin/@

Takes a primary command switch and optionally sub switches. The switches can 
be bundled together in a form such as  `@ -Syu` this will do: 
apt-get update, followed by apt-get upgrade.

Available switches are described below:

  --help, 
  -h, -?  - Displays this help message.
